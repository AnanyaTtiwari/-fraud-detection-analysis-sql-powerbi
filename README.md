# Fraud Detection Analysis using SQL & Power BI

## Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying potentially fraudulent and risky transactions using SQL and Power BI. 
The goal is to analyze transaction behavior and highlight suspicious patterns such as high-value transactions, 
late-night activity, frequent failures, and unusual spending behavior.

SQL is used to design the database, insert sample data, and perform advanced analysis using window functions 
and aggregations. Power BI is used to build an interactive dashboard that helps visualize transaction risk 
across time, cities, merchants, and payment methods.

## Tools & Skills Used
- SQL (Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions)
- Fraud Risk Analysis
- Power BI (DAX, KPI Cards, Slicers)
- Data Modeling
- GitHub Project Documentation

## Fraud Detection Rules
- High-value transactions (Amount > defined threshold)
- Late-night transactions (23:00 – 05:00)
- Multiple transactions within a short time window
- Failed transaction patterns
- City-wise and merchant-based risk analysis
